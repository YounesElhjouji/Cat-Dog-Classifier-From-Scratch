# Cat-Dog-Classifier-From-Scratch

Using Python to build a binary classifier for images cats and dogs from scratch (no machine learning libraries/frameworks used)

This project served as an introduction to deep learning concepts and techniques such as binary classification, gradient descent, backpropagation etc.. as well as a tool to understand the mathematical basis behind these concepts and techniques.

The results are not formidable, but the value learned through the project pushed me to easily go through more complicated topics.
